  "The team was provided with the following statistics for the 2005-2023 WNV seasons: min, max, mean, median, 90th and 10th percentile; along with number of cases for 2019 through 2023 by year-month.
  The data was aggregated into two regions: SoCal (Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino) and Central (Fresno, Kern, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare).
  Participants were then asked to answer the following questions for each month for each region: 1. The most likely number of cases in the indicated month will be ___, 2. The percent chance that at least one case will occur in the indicated month will be ___, 3. I am 90% sure that the number of cases in the indicated month will be greater than ___, and 4. I am 90% sure that the number of cases in the indicated month will be less than ___. 
  From these inputs, the regions were de-aggregated into counties by their historic contribution of cases to the total in the region, and a probabilistic forecast was constructed using the answer to question 2 to define the probability of zero cases, then the probabilities of one or more cases were defined based on a Poisson distribution if Prob(0 cases) > Prob(1 case) or a log-normal distribution based on quantile answers to questions 3 and 4 above."
